The cowplot package provides various features that help with creating publication-quality figures, such as a set of themes, functions to align plots and arrange them into complex compound figures, and functions that make it easy to annotate plots and or mix plots with images. The package was originally written for internal use in the Wilke lab, hence the name (Claus O. Wilke's plot package). The package has also been used extensively in the book  [Fundamentals of Data Visualization.](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1492031089)

# Installation

Until version 1.0 of cowplot is available on CRAN, it is recommended to install the latest development version of the package using the devtools package. In your R console, simply enter:

    devtools::install_github("wilkelab/cowplot")

The cowplot package is also on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=cowplot) and can be installed via

    install.packages("cowplot")

However, the version on CRAN (0.9.4) is outdated and many of the examples on this site will not work with cowplot 0.9.4.

# Usage
