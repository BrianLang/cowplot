Things that should be done before the next release
==================================================
- implement workaround for issue #60 and related ones,
https://github.com/wilkelab/cowplot/issues/60
- write vignette for aligning plots


Ideas for further development
=============================
- make a theme for individual plots and one for grouped plots (and one for faceted plots?), make sure that all default settings work well together.
