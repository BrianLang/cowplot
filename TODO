Bugs and problems
=============================
- all draw_* functions need to add `inherit.aes = FALSE` to the geom they call
- theme_cowplot doesn't draw nice legends anymore, grey boxes are back


Ideas for further development
=============================
- make a theme for individual plots and one for grouped plots (and one for faceted plots?), make sure that all default settings work well together.
- add functions to import and draw images
