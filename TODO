Before 1.0 release:
- Fix axis_canvas()
- Make sure background_grid() function works as expected
  (can't be used to modify the minimal grid themes; major = "only_minor" doesn't work
  reliably; only reliably approach is to always set all panel.grid theme elements to
  the required values. Add warning if major = "none" and minor not set to "none"?
  Alternatively, eliminate "only_minor" option.)
- Add as_grob() function for gList.

Things to fix or improve
=============================
- more regression tests are needed.
- write vignette on themes

Ideas for further development
=============================
- make a theme for individual plots and one for grouped plots (and one for faceted plots?), make sure that all default settings work well together.
